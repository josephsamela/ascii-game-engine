# ASCII Quest, TODO

## Engine
* Prevent whitespace in sprites from masking lower layers. Whitespace in sprites should be "transparent".
* Implement camera for allowing the character to move.
* Smooth out framebuffer render - very choppy.

## Animations
* Allow animations to run time-independent of the gameloop.

## Character
* Handle movement while jumping/falling
* Jump, fall and proper idle animations
* Attack animation!

## Items
Implement non-character

## Enemy
* Implement an "enemy" that just sort of flies around the map.
